Interacting with planets:
    Moving into a planet will transition the view from movement across a 2D plane
    perpendicular to the axis of rotation into a plane wrapped around the sphere
    itself. This allows retention of a simple interface without sacrificing the
    ability to interact with local elements on the surface of a big 3D object like
    a planet.

    Questions:

    How do we exit from this interface?

        Spore's solution is to link scale movement to zooming. In our case
        it may be more appropriate to have a keystroke or UI element.

    How do ships in orbit around planets interact with ships outside that orbit?

        To be solved later! If a good solution cannot be found, I think
        it is not entirely unacceptable to just disallow such interaction.
