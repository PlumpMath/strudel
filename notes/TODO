PENDING:

* Isolate graphical filter effects: star bloom on stars, galaxy glow on galaxy
* Find a way to speed up IPython event loop
* Some kind of sensible storage solution of complexity between pickling and SQL
* Planet generation for star system (preferably fast-- might need to regenerate for compression purposes)
* Change resolution on resize
* SoaSE-inspired interface

DONE:

* Exit on window close
