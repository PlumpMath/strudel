# strudel

An old unfinished gamedev project of mine using Python and Panda3D. It does some neat things:

- (somewhat) scientifically accurate galaxy generation using a barred spiral algorithm and star distribution chart
- A shader for rendering individual stars and their properties
- Astrocentric coordinate scaling
